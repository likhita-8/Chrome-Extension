# Chrome-Extension
Ever built a chrome extension? Build this easy JS project that allows you to save the current tab urls or any custom urls you want to save sent through the input box which will be in storage unless you decide to delete them all. 

The manifest.json does the background work for you to config it and add it to the extensions on chrome.
Fork it and run it on live server. 
If you wanna check it out on chrome, go to "chrome://extensions" page, go to:
- Load Unpacked Option on the top
- Choose the folder you have your code in 
- and save 
Now you can configure and add it as your extension and try out the functionality.

Topics such as localstorage, DOM, Event Listener, innerHTML, pushing values to array, template strings and many other concepts are used here.
